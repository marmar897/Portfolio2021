<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hi there! I am student at Lehman College and passionate about computer science ever since I attended an internship in high school called Girls Who Code. Before then, I didn't even know what computer science was because of the lack of options I had available to me in high school. It was only until I sought out education outside of my school that I found what I enjoyed. I want to help others in my community that are in the same position. Let's become passionate about learning together!</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
 <p> I like to create art, I often create bookmarks for friends and family. The picture above is a bookmark I hand painted inspired by Star Wars. I love listening to music especially live music. I also play billiards regularly and plan to enter a tournament soon! I also play tennis with my cousin every week. I try to stay active with my roller-skates, but right now I'm working on spins.</p>
